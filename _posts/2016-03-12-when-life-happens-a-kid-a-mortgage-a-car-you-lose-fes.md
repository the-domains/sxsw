## Why there is a growing industry for music festivals 

The music festival experience starts even before people have left their house to visit the festival. The focus of organizers has shifted from offering general headliners to designing total experiences. In other words, value propositions have transitioned from seeing your favorite bands to experiencing the festival as a whole. Amazing bands on a stage are just the entrance to the experience of a social connection. Europe has cultivated the festival scene for decades, US is just catching up.  

## How the industry has changed from buying music to experiencing music 

The combination of live music and the perceived connection with an artist is not replicable, unlike music records. Music festivals have more and more become focused on music discovery. Genres are disappearing altogether. People don't actually know what they want - but a good show is a good show - so individual visitor profiles have become less and less relevant. Virtual reality creates a whole new and heightened experience inside and outside the festival, unlike one-off holograms. Virtual reality offers opportunities for backstage experiences in particular.  

## How data is used to change the experience of music festivals 

Surveys are being focused on the comparison of historical experience versus current experience. This allows for a deep dive in personas, searching for emotional touch points. Beacon technology in mobile apps lead to migration patterns, e.g. statistics on patterns in the consumption of headliners. Schedules are organized according to both liking and scheduling, which happens months before the music festival, but the comparison of scheduled behavior versus actual behavior leads to the conclusion that "gut feelings still trump". Social media following is a measure of momentum for artists, data analysis of actual visitors predicts future success. Ultimately, permissions of data usage are in the hands of users

## Future opportunities based on data analysis 

Word-of-mouth can actually be tracked and measured, so the effectiveness of demographic targeting can be backed up by data analysis. Festivals can become more and more focused on niches and more personalized experiences can be offered. Large festivals will still play their role based on economies of scale, but many more and smaller festivals are to expected to start.
