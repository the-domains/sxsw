**"Homepage. Even the word sounds old. Today the news lives where you live."**

Ben Lerer's theory of media evolution: a change in technology leads to a change in consumer behavior and this creates massive opportunities for building large media and content companies.

**History repeats itself (but differently)**

The old pipe owners were cable companies that layed out the groundwork for a bunch of large media companies. The new pipe owners are social search companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon that control content distribution that lay out the groundwork for a bunch of online media companies. The biggest difference between the old pipe owners and the new pipe owners: the new pipe owners are growing through acquisitions of online media companies and technology companies that are disruptive to their own business. The old pipe owners weren't willing to disrupt their own business.

**How the new pipe owners differ from the old pipe owners**

The new pipe owners are tech centric (expertise), data centric (real-time decision making capability), have social DNA (be where your audience is), are mobile first (adapt the standard device) and create a real time newsroom (multichannel and multimedia). This resonates with millennial consumers and leads to truly native revenue generation with content costs in line with the ability to monetize. The new pipe owners are starting to become content companies and this is a really big deal. Think of Facebook Instant Articles, SnapChat Discover, Twitter Moments and Google's Amp Project. In summary, modern tools and tactics plus modern cost structures result in modern media companies.
