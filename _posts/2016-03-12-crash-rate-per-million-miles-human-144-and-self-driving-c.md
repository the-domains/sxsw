# "Crash rate per million miles: human 14.4 and self-driving car in autonomous mode 5.6"

Self-driving cars are primarily about increased security and preventing gridlocks. 162 lifetimes are wasted per day in the United States. Self-driving cars can also give people back their mobility, for example to blind people.  

## Chris Urmson on the self-driving car project of Google 

Lasers, cameras and radars provide for an incredible amount of sensing. Maps are combined with measurements to build a model of its surroundings. This model creates predictions for actions of other participants on the road and data is shared between vehicles and a central data center and back again to vehicles. A key learning from the self-driving car project of Google is that vehicles have to both generalize and be able to handle exceptions at the same time. The best solution for a self-driving car in an unfamiliar situation is to slow down and see how the situation plays out.  

## The future of the self-driving car

It is an incremental technology. It has to be better than human drivers but it is very difficult to determine how good a human driver has to be: freeways are easiest, urban centers are the most difficult. The self-driving car is therefore likely to be introduced on freeways first.
